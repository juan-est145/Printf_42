A repository containing the printf project of 42 Malaga. The aim of this project is to replicate the printf function, which requires understanding how 
variadic functions work. To run this project, simply type "make" in the terminal at the root of the project, and the makefile will generate a static library.

If you are a fellow student at 42, DO NOT COPY ANYTHING FROM THIS REPOSITORY THAT YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND, use it to learn instead.
